The columns are poorly named, and I don't want many of them, since many are empty, or meaningful in an Excel format but not for our purposes. Things like trend arrows and what have you don't translate to a dataframe. 

I also want to, in the end, have the country name as the index of this data, and I don't want any columns or rows where all the data are missing. 

Let's begin with the columns renaming, as that will make explicitly dropping some of them easier later on.
